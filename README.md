NOTE: _Do not use any form of AI_. This project is to help you build the skills needed to succeed in the workforce, and while you _will_ be using AI when working in the industry, you _also_ need to fully understand what it is you are doing. This is not the time to use AI. It's the time to learn. Don't use AI on this project.

## Overview

You are going to be building a basic weather application that uses the weather.gov API, found here: [https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-apiLinks to an external site.](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). It will have these pages and sections:

* Home
    * Modal with a form to sign in (doesn't do anything yet)
        * Username
        * Password
        * Forgot username or password
    * Navbar:
        * Links to the "About", "FAQ", and "Contact" pages
    * Sidebar from bootstrap (you'll find it under the "Navbar" components), find one that lets you expand/collapse like a drawer
        * You are welcome to use something other than bootstrap
    * Cards:
        * Current weather conditions
        * Current weather alerts (e.g. Excessive Heat Warning)
        * Have a card that displays the weather over the next 24 hours
            * Use a line chart from Chart.js: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/line/line.html
* About
    * Have a simple description of who you are and why you made this site. Remember that this is likely going to be on your portfolio, so I would advise not saying something like "I'm making this site because my teacher is a cruel taskmaster who is mercilessy making me build this in order to pass the class. He laughs even now as my tears stain the keys of my laptop."
* FAQ
    * Add a couple sample entries
* Contact
    * Add a form with these fields:
        * Name
        * Email
        * Category
            * Question
            * Feature request
            * Bug
            * Report
        * Message
## Target design

Your layout will look like this, though obviously with different content:

## Submission

You'll submit a link to your github repo. Make sure you follow best practices and use HTML 5 semantic element usage, don't use inline css/javascript, use flexbox, have "use strict"; at the top of your javascript files, etc.
